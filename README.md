An application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs.
It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. 
A document or standard that describes how to build such a connection or interface is called an API specification.
A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. 
The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.
